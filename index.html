					<h1>History of programming languages</h1>
				</section>

				<section> <!--slide2-->
					<p>
						<small>
						The history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to modern tools for software development. 
						Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on mathematical notation and similarly obscure syntax.
						Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory lead to the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate instructions.
						The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and 1945. The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951, for his PhD thesis. 
						The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation), developed in 1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at IBM.

						   <small>
							The first-ever programming language was an algorithm that was created by Ada Lovelace in 1883. Ada Lovelace created this algorithm for Charles Babbage’s Analytical engine.
							The purpose of this algorithm was to compute Bernoulli numbers.
							In 1936, the first time, the computer codes were specialized by Alonzo Church and Alan Turing. Church expressed lambda calculus in a formulaic way.

					<h3>Assembly Language</h3>
						<p>
							<small>
								The first modern computers (electrically powered) were created in the 1940s. These computers were limited in speed and memory capacity. 
								Because of such limitations, programmers were forced to write assembly language programs manually. Being a low-level programming language, it was a tough task to program it manually. 
								Programmers then realized the need for high-level languages to lower the effort that was required for writing the assembly language programs manually.

					<h3>First programming languages</h3>
					<p>
						<img src="img/first.jpg" width="500" height="300">
						<small>
						In the 1940s, the first recognizably modern electrically powered computers were created. The limited speed and memory capacity forced programmers to write hand-tuned assembly language programs. It was eventually realized that programming in assembly language required a great deal of intellectual effort.
						An early proposal for a high-level programming language was Plankalkül, developed by Konrad Zuse for his Z1 computer between 1943 and 1945 but not implemented at the time.
						The first functioning programming languages designed to communicate instructions to a computer were written in the early 1950s.

					<h4>Further Developments and Establishing Programming Paradigms</h4>
					<p>
						<small>
							COBOL was the first high-level programming language that could run on the type or brand of computers. It was developed in 1959 and it stands for COmmon Business Oriented Language. 
							It is used in card processing, ATMs, and even it was used in the movie Terminator for the Terminator’s visual display. The same year, LISP was invented by  John McCarthy for use in artificial intelligence. These languages are still in use.
							Many programming languages were developed in the last decade. There were many improvements but still programming was a tough task.  John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz decided to create something for students who do not have good programming and mathematical understandings. 
							They created a family of easily useable programming languages and named it BASIC. Years later, Bill Gates and Paul Allen modified BASIC and this modified version ended up as the first product of Microsoft.

					<h6>Further Developments and Establishing Programming Paradigms</h6>
					<p>
						<img src="img/image2.png" width="300px" height="400px">
						<small>
							In 1972, Dennis Ritchie developed the C programming language. C became one of the most popular programming languages and in the coming years. 
							It heavily influenced many programming languages such as Java, C++, GO, Ruby, Javascript, Perl, and Python.
							The same year in 1972,  Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce developed SQL.

					<h6>Consolidations and Improvements in the 1980s</h6>
					<p>
						<small>
							In this decade, instead of developing new paradigms, improvements were made to inventions of the last decade. One of such consolidations was C++. 
							C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983. It is an extension of C, with an important feature, object-oriented programming. It combined systems and object-oriented programming. 
							Today, C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages. It is heavily used in game engines and web development. Popular software such as adobe photoshop also uses C++.
							Another very important trend added during this time was the usage of modules, or simply, large-scale organizational units of code. In the future, modules became a very important part of the programming world. Also, the object-oriented features such as polymorphism originated in this decade.
							Objective-C, the main language used in Apple’s operating system, macOS and IOS was developed in 1983. Other notable languages developed during this period were Perl in 1987 by Larry Wall, Tcl in 1988 by Tcl core team, Ada in 1983, Common Lisp in 1984 and Eiffel in 1984

					<h6>The Internet Age</h6>
					<img src="img/The-internet-age.jpg" width="500px" height="300px">
					<p>
						<small>
							By the end of the 1980s, the internet age began. The rapid growth of the internet was a major key point in the programming language world. 
							One of the most important, as well as the most widely used programming language today, Javascript was created in 1995. 
							It was created by Brendan Eich in just 10 days. Earlier, no one though Javascript would become such a huge thing in the programming world. 
							This is why no one paid attention to javascript at that time. Today, it is one of the most popular programming languages, and almost every website that exists today is built on javascript. 
							It is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, the other two being CSS and HTML.

					<h6>Java, Python and JavaScript</h6>
					<img src="img/Java.png" width="300px" height="250px">
					<img src="img/Python.png" width="300px" height="250px">
					<img src="img/JavaScript.jpg" width="300px" height="250px">
					<p>
						<small>
							Another major high-level programming language that came out in the 1990s was Java. Originally, it was developed for cable boxes and hand-held devices. But it enhanced so much that today, it is almost everywhere. 
							In 1991, Guido Van Rossum created a very user-friendly programming language. He named it Python because he loved the British comedy group Monty Python so much. Python went on becoming a very popular language in the upcoming years. 
							JavaScrpt was created in just 10 days by Brendan Eich, this language is mostly used to enhance many Web browser interactions. Almost every major website uses Javascript.
							Today, along with java and javascript, python is one of the most popular languages.

					<h6>The Growth of Modern Programming Languages</h6>
					<img src="img/modern.jpg" width="400px" height="200px">
					<p>
						<small>
							The evolution of programming languages continued with the start of a new century. Microsoft developed C# in 2001, it is very similar to C++, Java, and Visual Basic. 
							C# is heavily used in Microsoft products, and desktop applications. In 2003, Martin Odersky created Scala that is used in Android development. 
							Go was developed by Google in 2003 to address problems that were originating in large software systems. Later in the next decade, Google also invented another useful language, Dart.
							Dart is used in Flutter to create cross-platform mobile applications.  TypeScript invented in 2012 is an important part of the Angular framework. Apple also developed a new language, named Swift in 2014 as a replacement for C#, C, and C++.

					<h6>Conclusion</h6>
					<p>
						<small>
							Programming languages have covered a lot in the last seventy years. From creating tough programs in assembly language to extremely user-friendly python programs, no doubt there is too much improvement. 
							Thousands of people had worked during these decades. Some of the most prominent people of the programming language world are Dennis Ritchie, James Gosling, Guido van Rossum, John Backus, Konrad Zuse,
							Rasmus Lerdorf, Cleve Moler, Chris Lattner, Bjarne Stroustrup, Anders Hejlsberg, and Yukihiro Matsumoto. There are many others. But inventions and improvements did not stop here.
							This will continue in the future and maybe, it will continue forever.
